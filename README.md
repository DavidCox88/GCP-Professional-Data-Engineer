Study notes for the Professional Data Engineer Certification

## Official-Study-Guide-Notes
This folder contains a summary of the notes I made while reading the [Official Google Cloud Certified Professional Data Engineer Study Guide](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Official-Google-Certified-Professional-Engineer/dp/1119618436). Google Cloud products are highlighted in green to make them stand out when reading.
Note - these notes are not a subsitute for reading the book, they were used by me to provide a summary of the book to aid in my revision.
